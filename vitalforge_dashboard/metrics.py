"""The metric-key -> table mapping.

Its own module because app.py, export_routes.py and (in principle) goals.py all
need it, and app.py imports the route modules -- so anything they share cannot
live in app.py without a cycle. goals.py's docstring notes it validates metric
names in app.py rather than here precisely because "importing app from this
sibling" was circular; this is the seam that fixes that, whenever goals wants it.
