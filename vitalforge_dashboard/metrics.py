"""The metric-key -> table mapping.

Its own module because app.py, export_routes.py and goals.py all need it, and
app.py imports the route modules -- so anything they share cannot live in app.py
without a cycle. goals.py used to validate metric names in app.py precisely
because "importing app from this sibling" was circular; it now imports from here
instead, which is what this module exists for.
